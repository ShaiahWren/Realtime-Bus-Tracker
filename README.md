# Real-time bus tracker
This program uses mapbox to show bus movement along stops between MIT and Harvard campuses. 
# How to Run
Ensure the following files are on local machine: manipulation.js, index.html, and styles.css. Drag and drop index.html into the browser to begin the program.

# Future improvements
This program could be improved my adding additional functionality to stop the movement of pacmen. User controls could be an interesting feature where key presses could influence pacmen movement.
