# Real-time bus tracker
This program uses mapbox to show bus movement along stops between MIT and Harvard campuses. 
# How to Run
Ensure the following files are on local machine: mapanimation.js, index.html, and styles.css. Drag and drop index.html into the browser to begin the program.

# Future improvements
I would like to change marker icons to bus icons for a more intuitive user experience. The buses could change color based on the occupancy level of the vehicle.
